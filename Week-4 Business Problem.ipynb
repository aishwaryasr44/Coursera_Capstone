    "Toronto is a major Canadian city, having large number of immigrants coming every year. Choosing the correct neighbourhood on a foreign land after considering several major factors like the locality, nearby places, schools for kids, etc. is big decision to make. This Project will help people moving in to Toronto in choosing their neighborhood depending on the facilities in that area. This will help people to make smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of a number of other neighborhoods present in Toronto.\n",

For the past 70 years, while Ontario has received the highest number of immigrants of any province or territory, Toronto has been the hot spot for these newcomers.\n",
